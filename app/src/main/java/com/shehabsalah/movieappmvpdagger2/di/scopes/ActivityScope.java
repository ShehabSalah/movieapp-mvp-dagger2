/**
 * Created by shehabsalah on 2/2/18.
 * In Dagger, an unscoped component cannot depend on a scoped component. As
 * {@link AppComponent} is a scoped component ({@code @Singleton}, we create a custom
 * scope to be used by all activity components. Additionally, a component with a specific scope
 * cannot have a sub component with the same scope.
